## Enter Salone, non-profit organization supporting local human rights groups and grassroots organisations in Sierra Leone.

In 2012 I founded the non-profit organization ENTER Salone which offers support to local human rights
organizations and grassroots groups in Sierra Leone who work tirelessly on violence prevention and response, human dignity and human rights issues but who often lack teh resources and technical support to have a lasting impact. 
ENTER Salone offers such assistance while leaving the direction of teh projects in the hand of Sierra Leoneans themselves.
