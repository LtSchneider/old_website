##Abstract

The ‘gender acts’ passed in 2007 and 2012, regarding intimate
partner (sexual) violence though extremely progressive on
paper, are starkly disconnected from the changing social landscapes, lived experiences and social codes, which govern marriages and cohabitation in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Using
practice theory (e.g. Karp 1986, Ortner 2006) to analyze and
challenge the social, cultural and historical contexts of intimate
partner sexual violence, and to examine notions about and
access to justice, this article explores the intersection between
human agency, social, legal and institutional structures, and
forms of power (Karp, 1986, p.132, 134). Qualitative methodology is used to investigate how sexual assault is conceived in
heterosexual relationships in Sierra Leone and to analyze why
married or cohabitating women only seldom report the assault
they suffer to the police and why cases predominantly end
with a dismissal or an out of court solution, euphemistically
referred to as ‘friendly settlements.’ The article argues for an
intersectional approach towards intimate partner sexual violence. It conceives of women’s responses to such violence
within the nexus between individual, community and state
regulations, paying attention to the specific socially embedded
agency they enable. The article contends that the pressures on
women that cause them to prioritize social and economic
security over justice need to be accounted for.
