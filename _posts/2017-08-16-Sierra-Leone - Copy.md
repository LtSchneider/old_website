There are no words. This beautiful country with its strong, resilient, friendly people with tremendous heart and hospitality which has suffered through slavery and colonialism and has endured not only a civil war, but several health emergencies including the Ebola pandemic, is suffering yet another tragedy.

On August 14, 2017 flooding and mudslides killed hundreds of people in Freetown. 600 people are still missing. 

Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed and thousands have lost their homes. 

People are trying to rescue survivors from the mud.

There is the risk of furter flooding. 

Facing the threat of diseases such as cholera and typhoid Sierra Leoneans struggle to recover bodies and to give hundreds of victims a dignified burial.
