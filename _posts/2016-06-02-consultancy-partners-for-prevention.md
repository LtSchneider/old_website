## Partners for Prevention

[link](http://www.partners4prevention.org/) to the P4P homepage.

Partners for Prevention (P4P) is a UN regional joint programme for the prevention of violence against women and girls (VAWG) in Asia and the Pacific. The joint programme brings together the combined strengths of the four UN agencies, along with governments and civil society, to promote and implement more effective violence prevention programmes and policies. The programme is organised in two Phases.


## Phase 1

P4P Phase 1 was implemented from September 2008 to December 2013. Achievements of the first phase include the UN Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific (MCS on Men and Violence), which provides seminal data on men’s perpetration of different forms of violence against women, and identifies key entry points and changes needed to prevent this violence.  Other achievements include the results of two sub regional NGO learning consortia focused on transforming masculinities.  These learning consortia consolidated the knowledge, tools and skills needed to undertake more transformative work on gender norms and masculinities associated with violence and inequality; and on the solidarity and cooperation among various stakeholders that is needed to realize such transformations. The communications advocacy and strategy of Phase I ensured the learning generated was strategically communicated to selected target groups, for example through social media-based campaigns engaging young people in prevention.  P4P Phase 1 also consolidated learning on harnessing volunteerism for prevention.  

## Phase 2

P4P Phase 2 will carry forward the successes and learning of Phase 1 by implementing, rigorously monitoring and evaluating, and documenting learning from selected sites where P4P research has been undertaken and strong partnerships established. The interventions, to be implemented in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, PNG and Viet Nam, will be carefully designed based on the site specific recommendations of the UN MSC on Men and Violence combined with local knowledge and global evidence of what is working to prevent violence against women and girls. 


## Capacity Building

Capacity building is central to P4P II, focusing on increasing the capacity of national partners and regional organizations in violence against women and girls prevention policy and programming.  In Phase II, P4P aims to enhance institutional capacity on prevention programming and promote volunteerism and policy advocacy at the national level. P4P aims at enhancing capacities to implement well-designed, multi-component and evidence-based primary prevention interventions in the future and to advocate for policy and priority changes to prevent violence against women and girls and ensure women’s human rights. The target of capacity building activities includes UN agencies, government counterparts, implementing partners as well as key violence against women and girls primary prevention actors at (the) country level. Regional results also include enhanced capacity of regional organizations and bodies to undertake effective violence prevention programming and policy advocacy. P4P II will nurture cross-border exchanges through a Regional Learning Network and undertake targeted policy advocacy at the regional level.  For more information, please see:

P4P conducted a partner capacity assessment survey to set a baseline and determine partner organizations' needs to plan capacity development interventions at country level in Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Vietnam, as well as for the regional learning network to be established.  

## Objectives of Capacity Assessment 

### The main objectives of the partner capacity assessment are: 

1. To assess partners'  current level of capacity to implement P4P interventions; 
2. To map out gaps and weaknesses as well as strengths related to primary prevention of violence, monitoring and evaluation, and volunteer mobilization;
3. To identify country level stakeholders of violence against women and girls primary prevention and masculinity issues for the Regional Learning Network;
4. To set a baseline for capacity in  primary prevention of violence against women and girls interventions; 
5. To inform the capacity development strategy and design capacity development interventions. 

This assessment focuses on specific technical experience of partners in violence against women prevention, working with men and boys to transform masculinities as well as volunteerism, and it is meant to be complementary to the agency specific assessment at country level.
