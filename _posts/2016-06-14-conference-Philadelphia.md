# \"Something heavy/something light\": the multifaceted lived experiences,opinions and emotions of women experiencing gender-based violence in
Freetown, Sierra Leone

## Abstract
> Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork on (sexual) relationships and gender-based violence in post-war and post Ebola Freetown this paper maps the multi-layered positions, emotions and attitudes of women who experience GBV. Rather than assuming a position of resilience or victimhood, it is the women who define their experiences and my work is based on their positioning and terminologies. 
>
>I accompanied my respondents in their day-to-day lives and conducted life history interviews. My respondentsâ€™ experiences are analysed based on their positioning, their trajectories and daily lived realities as well as broader social, economic, and cultural conditions.
